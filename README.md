# React SVG Components

This is a collection of TypeScript React [components](https://github.com/dan-mba/react-svg-components/tree/main/src/components) that will render a SVG.

This project also demonstrates using [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) to view & test the components.

The Storybook development server can be run using `npm run storybook`
